.TH _printf
.SH NAME

.B _printf - formatted output conversion

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functions _printf() write output to stdout, the standard output stream.
This function write the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS

A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.IP -c
The argument passed for specifier "%c" is of type int. "%c" prints a single character.
.IP -s
The argument passed for specifier "%s" is a string of type char *. "%s" prints the string pointed to by the char *.
.IP -%
No argument is passed for specifier "%%", it will only print a percent sign "%".
.IP -d
The argument passed for specifier "%d" is of type int. "%d" print a decimal integer (assumes base 10).
.IP -i
The argument passed for specifier "%i" is of type int. "%i" print a decimal integer (detects the base automatically).

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
If an output error is encountered, -1 is returned.

.SH EXAMPLES
_printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');

			will print:    Character:[H]


_printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");

			will print:    String:[I am a string !]


_printf("Percent:[%%]\n");

			will print:    Percent:[%]


.SH BUGS
Note that this function will not work if the conversion specifier is not present in this man page.
